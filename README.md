## Hi, I'm Adam Lucas.
- I am an Applied Coastal and Ocean Sciences PhD student working under PI Dr. Phil Bresnahan in the UNCW COAST Lab.
- My research focuses on developing a multiparameter optical sensor for measuring water quality, with the goal of distribution within participatory science networks.
- In my free time I enjoy making music and doing a variety of outdoor activities (running, kayaking, rock climbing, etc.).
